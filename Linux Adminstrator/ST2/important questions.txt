THEORY QUESTIONS FOR THE ST-1 LINUX EXAM

1.linux components

ANS- 

Kernel: The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It is responsible for managing system resources, running processes, and handling input and output.

Shell: The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system. It interprets user commands and executes them.

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Linux also includes a graphical user interface that provides a more user-friendly environment for interacting with the operating system.

File system: Linux uses a hierarchical file system, where all files and directories are organized into a tree-like structure. The root directory (/) is the top-level directory, and all other directories are organized below it.

Utilities: Linux includes a wide range of utilities and tools that provide functionality for managing files, manipulating text, networking, and more. Some of the most common utilities include the grep, sed, awk, and find utilities.

Applications: Linux also includes a wide range of applications, including text editors, web browsers, email clients, and multimedia players. Many of these applications are open source and freely available for download.

Libraries: Linux includes a wide range of libraries that provide functionality for application development. These libraries include the GNU C Library, the GTK library for GUI development, and many others.

2.installation process linux centos?

ANS-Download the CentOS ISO file: Go to the CentOS website and download the ISO file for the version of CentOS you want to install.

Create a bootable USB or DVD: Burn the CentOS ISO file to a USB flash drive or DVD using a tool like Rufus or Etcher.

Boot from the USB or DVD: Insert the USB or DVD into your computer and boot from it. This can be done by changing the boot order in your computer's BIOS or by using a boot menu.

Select installation options: Once the CentOS installer boots, select your language, keyboard layout, and other installation options.

Partition the hard drive: Use the CentOS installer to partition your hard drive, creating the necessary partitions for the operating system and any data you want to store.

Install CentOS: Follow the prompts to install CentOS on your hard drive. You will need to select the installation type, such as a minimal or full installation, and configure network settings and user accounts.

Reboot: Once the installation is complete, reboot your computer and log in to CentOS.

This is a simplified overview of the CentOS installation process, and there may be additional steps depending on your specific installation requirements. However, these are the basic steps you will need to follow to install CentOS on your computer.

4.absolute and relative path

ANS- In Linux, a file or directory can be referred to using two types of paths: absolute paths and relative paths.

ABSOLUTE PATHS: An absolute path is the full path of a file or directory from the root directory, represented by a forward slash (/).
For example, the absolute path of the /etc/passwd file is /etc/passwd. Absolute paths always start with the root directory and provide a complete path to the file or directory.

RELATIVE PATHS: A relative path is a path that is relative to the current directory. It does not start with the root directory.
Relative paths are specified using two special symbols:

"." (dot) represents the current directory.
".." (dot dot) represents the parent directory.
For example, suppose you are currently in the /home/user directory, and you want to access the file myfile.txt located in the /home/user/documents directory. You can use a relative path to refer to this file as follows:

If the /home/user/documents directory is a subdirectory of the current directory, you can use the path "./documents/myfile.txt".
If the /home/user/documents directory is the parent directory of the current directory, you can use the path "../documents/myfile.txt".
Relative paths are useful when navigating between directories and accessing files or directories that are nearby in the directory tree.

In summary, an absolute path is the complete path to a file or directory from the root directory, while a relative path is a path that is relative to the current directory.

5.difference vi ,vim ,nano and sed?

ANS- Vi: Vi stands for Visual Editor and is the ancestor of all modern text editors. Vi is a command-line text editor that is included in almost every Unix-based system. It is designed for experienced users who prefer keyboard commands to edit text files. It is a powerful text editor but has a steep learning curve.

Vim: Vim is an improved version of Vi that stands for Vi Improved. It is also a command-line text editor, but with additional features and functionality that make it easier to use. Vim has a more user-friendly interface and comes with features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and multiple windows.

Nano: Nano is a simple, user-friendly, and intuitive text editor that is often used as an alternative to Vi and Vim. It is designed to be easy to use and can be operated using simple keyboard commands. Nano has fewer features than Vim, but it is an excellent choice for users who need a basic text editor.

Sed: Sed stands for Stream Editor and is used to modify text streams. It is a command-line utility that is used to perform text transformations on a file or input stream. Sed is typically used in conjunction with other Unix-based tools, such as grep and awk, to perform complex text manipulations.

In summary, Vi and Vim are command-line text editors with powerful features and a steep learning curve. Nano is a simple and user-friendly text editor with fewer features than Vim, while Sed is a command-line utility used to perform text transformations on a file or input stream.

6.difference cat and echo

ANS- The main difference between cat and echo is that cat is used to display the contents of a file on the console, while echo is used to display a message or print text to the console.

Here are some additional differences between the two commands:

cat can be used to display the contents of one or more files on the console, while echo can only display the text that is passed as an argument.

cat can be used to concatenate multiple files and output the result to the console or a file, while echo cannot.

cat can be used with various options and arguments to modify its behavior, such as to number the lines of a file, while echo has fewer options and is mainly used to display text on the console.

echo can be used to write text to a file using output redirection (>), while cat is primarily used to display the contents of a file and not to write to a file.

In summary, cat is primarily used to display the contents of one or more files on the console, while echo is used to display a message or print text to the console. They have different functionalities and can be used in different ways, depending on the task at hand.

7.linux architecture

ANS- The Linux operating system has a layered architecture that consists of four main components:

Hardware layer: This layer consists of physical hardware components such as the CPU, memory, hard disks, and network cards.

Kernel layer: This layer is the core of the operating system and interacts directly with the hardware. It provides services such as process management, memory management, input/output management, and device driver management.

Shell and Utilities layer: This layer provides an interface for users to interact with the system. The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to issue commands and execute programs, while the utilities are command-line tools used to perform various tasks such as file management, text manipulation, and networking.

Application layer: This layer consists of user-level applications such as text editors, web browsers, multimedia players, and other software programs.

These layers are designed to be modular and independent, with each layer relying on the services provided by the layer below it. This architecture allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization, as users and developers can modify and replace components at any layer to suit their needs.

8.linux file types

ANS- There are three types of files.

Regular File
Directory
Special Files

Special files are again catagorized into five other file types.

Character Files
These files represent devices under the /dev file system.
Examples include the devices such as the keyboard and mouse.

Block Files
These files represent block devices also located under /dev/ file system.
Examples include the harddisks and RAM

Links
Links in linux is a way to associate two or more file names to the same set of file data.
There are two types of links-
-The Hard Link
-The Soft Link

Sockets
A sockets is a special file that enables the communication between two processes.

Named Pipes
The Named Pipes is a special type of file that allows connecting one process as an input to another
